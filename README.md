# codecollab

This is a realtime online code collaboration editor.

This is made by me and two of my friends for
HackU coding contest by Yahoo! hosted in our
university campus. We started coding at 9PM in
the night and went on until 11AM on the next
morning. We have decided to continue developing
this and fix the bugs which are present now.

**By the way, We won HackU**


Hopefully, we will release a bug-free version soon.
